Question 1: 

Total - 7760M
Free - 6234 

Question 2: The memory seems to be going up as the program keeps running an allocating more memory. When I kill it seems to go back to normal.
The numbers did not match my expectations because I thought the numbers would be much larger. 

Question 7: I get the process's  memory map and the C libraries.


Question 8: To be honest all I see if abunch of garble. The only thing I do see is that the memory address is getting bigger in hexadecimal it kind of does match my expectations that the virtual address would get larger as the memory gets larger.
